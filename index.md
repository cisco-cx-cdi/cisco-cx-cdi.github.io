    title: "Partner Projects"
    excerpt: "Partners act as the glue between customers and Cisco. Partners are on the front lines with supporting customer needs. Cisco needs to be able to support partners with the insights and capabilities necessary to provide impactful customer experiences. However, every partner has different needs, and different capabilities. How can Cisco provide deep value to partners through data in a scalable way? Our team aims to provide partners with the AI&ML driven systems necessary to understand their customers and provide deep value. By strengthening partners through data driven insights, customers have more meaningful experiences, which grows both Cisco and its parners."

  - title: "Unofficial Blog"
  - excerpt: "
  This blog was created to showcase the work being done within the Customer Experience (CX) org at Cisco by a select group of data scientists. Our motivation is to espouse the capabilities that AI and ML can bring to all aspects of businesses and how they serve and interact with their customers. While much of our work revolves around applying AI and ML for improving customer experiences, we work on projects that span the realm of technical data science domains that can be applied well beyond customer experience. Our goal is to reach technical practitioners attempting to understand how to apply the techniques of AI and ML to business domains, and to the tech savy business leads looking for some guides as to how AI can be leveraged to gain real business value.  
  
  Please note that this is not an official Cisco company blog. This blog does not speak for Cisco and will not articulate Cisco's position on anything. We want to share our experiences with data, methods, approaches, tools, platforms, ideas, etc... to stimulate technical professionals into thinking deeply on how to bring AI and ML into every aspect of business. We want to share everything we've learned with the wider community of technical professionals.
  
  Thanks for visiting!
